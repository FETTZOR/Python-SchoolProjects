# In a farming-simulator game, you can buy certain vehicles for a specific price. As a player, you want to buy the
# most useful (i.e. the most expensive) vehicle. Here are the vehicles and their prices:
#
# Item: Price
#
# Bicycle: 23
#
# Pickup: 678
#
# Light Tractor: 1296
#
# Medium Tractor: 3848
#
# Heavy Tractor: 6769
#
# Write a program that determines what is the most expensive vehicle that the user can buy with their money and how
# many of them they can buy.
#
# Note that you should only find one kind of vehicle to buy (the most expensive). You don't need to mention any
# alternative options. For example, if the user has 710 coins, your program should output 1 pickup' \ ',
# but not 1 pickup\n30 bicycles or anything like that.
#
# The input format:
#
# The money that the user has.
#
# The output format:
#
# How many vehicles the user can afford, for example, 20 bicycles. If the user cannot afford any vehicle, write None.
