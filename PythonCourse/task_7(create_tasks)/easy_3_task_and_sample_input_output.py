# You need to write a program that converts miles to kilometers.
# In this program, you should:
#
# 1. Round values to one decimal place. Like (2.333333 = 2.3)
# 2. Write 3 functions. Where one of them converting miles to km, second km to mi(miles)
# and 3rd call the necessary function depending on what was given in the input(in mi or in km)
# 3. Print the converted speed value with the new unit
# 4. On wrong input says Wrong input, please, try again!

# Sample input / output
# Enter value>? 2
# Wrong input, please, try again!
# Enter value>? 1 km
# 0.62 miles
